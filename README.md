Techno Democratic Movement
==========================

The Techno Democratic Movement believes that the goal of governing institutions is to allow for the increase of wisdom and welfare for all humanity by stimulating the development of technology and science.

These are its (current) core principles: 

1- The Techno Democratic Movement (TDM) should base its principles and ideals on science, and as such, is expected to change as humanity advances its knowledge.

2- The TDM favors academic rigor over popularity. It is therefore important that every decision and every principle is added not by popular vote, but by applying the scientific method rigorously. The same is true for the selection of its leading members. 

3- The TDM can never have only one leading member, but there is no upward limit. Leading members are the only one's allowed to accept propositions for changes in policies, beliefs, and principles. The Leading members' selection process is defined under Movement/Policies and changes to it will incur the same rigour as any other proposition. 

4- If no clear evidence based conclusion can be drawn, the proposition cannot be accepted. It is therefore advised to change the scope of the proposition and resubmit it.

5- Only propositions that further humanity's wellfare and its scientific potential can be accepted. It can never favor science over wellfare and vice versa. Any other goal is out of TDM's scope.
