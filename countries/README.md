The countries section of TDM is supposed to add granularity to the movement.

1- Each country should have its specific folder which will address the issues specific to that country.

2- A country can only add policies, strategies, and ideals to TDM, it may never remove from the core.

3- A country must have at least one leading member that represents that country.

4- Any member can make propositions to changes in any country, regardless of nationality.

5- All propositions to a country should be considered equally, regardless of origin.
